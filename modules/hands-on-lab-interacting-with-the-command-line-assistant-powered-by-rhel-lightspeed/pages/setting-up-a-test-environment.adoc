= Setting Up a Test Environment for RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant

To effectively demonstrate the capabilities of the RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant, it's essential to set up a test environment. This environment should mimic a real-world scenario, allowing users to interact with the assistant and perform various tasks. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up such an environment:

## Prerequisites

1. **Root Access**: Ensure you have root or sudo privileges on your system to install necessary packages and make configuration changes.
2. **RHEL System**: The test environment should be a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system where you can enable and utilize the RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant.

## Step 1: Install Required Packages

Before setting up the test environment, ensure that you have the necessary packages installed. In this case, we'll focus on the `httpd` package to demonstrate the assistant's capabilities in troubleshooting web server configurations.

1. Update your system's package index:
   ```
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

2. Install the `httpd` package:
   ```
   sudo dnf install -y httpd
   ```

## Step 2: Verify the Installation

Verify that the `httpd` package has been installed correctly by listing its version:

1. Execute the following command to list the installed `httpd` package version:
   ```
   sudo rpm -qa httpd
   ```
   You should see an output similar to:
   ```
   httpd-2.4.62-2.fc40.x86_64
   ```

2. Display the content of the `httpd.conf` file:
   ```
   sudo cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
   ```
   This file contains the main Apache HTTP server configuration directives.

## Step 3: Enable and Start the HTTPD Service

Enable and start the `httpd` service to ensure it's running:

1. Enable the service to start on boot:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable httpd
   ```

2. Start the service:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   ```

3. Verify that the service is active and enabled:
   ```
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```

## Step 4: Configure SELinux for Testing
